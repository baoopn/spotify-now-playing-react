# Spotify Currently Playing

This Create React App (CRA) is used to display the currently playing track of the user as well as their 5 most recently played tracks using the Spotify API.

## Made with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Node Version

This app was developed using Create React App v5 with Node.js v16. For best compatibility, please use Node.js v16. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage and switch between different versions of Node.js.

### Use Node.js v16

```sh
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

Ensure you are using Node.js v16 before running the project:

```sh
node -v
# Should output: v16.x.x
```

## Create .env

Use the template `.env.example`.

To sync with your account, you'll need three things from Spotify Developer:
- Client ID
- Client secret
- Refresh token
